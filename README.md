# ProjectAL
Testing For Project AL
/*What this is:

Project Alien Life is an upcoming game made entirely by me.
Started 1/15/2021
The game is about living the life of an alien, as you probably guessed.
It's a small rogue-like that gives players the freedom of choice.
Spawn in as a random alien species equipped with their own special perk.
And survive the harsh, weird, and chaotic variables.
Targetting a late Summer release.

Music will be done by me.
As well as art
And the animations.
Art-> Pixel Art, done in Aseprite
The Code here, is everything so far done.








//------------------------------------


As of 3/9

2 new Npc's added.
6 Misc. items added. These are items that serve no direct purpose(such as recovering health or boosting stats), but may serve as crafting pieces later.
These misc. items drop randomly from monsters.
Additionaly, also added 'Skill Crystals'. These also drop randomly from monsters, and are needed to unlock skills in the future.
The 'Skill Unlock Vendors/NPCs" are associated with the two newly added NPCs.










//------------------------------------

As of 3/5 Six Alien species are available to the players. Perks are not in.

The scripts for dialog are completed. Using scriptable objects, I can easily create dialog entries for Npcs. Furthermore, I also added a response system for the player. With this, the player can choose between different dialog responses, resulting in different passive stat changes.

Player stats are randomly given on entry. Make do with what ya got.

Speed not yet affecting actual movement speed. I need to think of a decent modular formula.

Item scripts have been created as well as an inventory system. Items can be added to the player inventory easily, and it will show within the editor; however, I haven't drawn out the art for the inventory, so it does not show in game.

Enemy scripts have been created. I can now easily add enemies within the game; give it health, damage to the player, as well as items for it to drop. Items can be dropped with a percent chance based on the values I give in the editor. Nice.  

The distance that the enemy aggros the player, as well as the speed at which the enemy moves and chases the player, are both based on the values I give in the editor. 

Enemy attacks the player, buuut the movement scripts need more work, the enemy is chasing the player off of edges.

Npcs are in the game, however only about 8 are currently in.

Shop system script is added as well. As of now, it is not active on any Npc, however, I can easily create inventories for an Npc to "hold", and on command, allow the player to open and buy items within the inventory. They will be added to the player inventory, and your money counter will be reduced based on the value I give in the editor. Nice.



Next on the Agenda------
//Create a script that saves player data and allow player to transfer to different scenes. From here, I can create "scenario" systems that'll throw players into different scenes based on dialog choice.

//Add more enemies.(currently only 2)
//Add more Npcs.
//Tidy up shop system, allowing full player to npc control.
//Create s script that allows items to be "used", to give items different functions.
//More ART
//Add lighting system and sound.
